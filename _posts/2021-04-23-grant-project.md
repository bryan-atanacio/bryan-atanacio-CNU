# Dungeons and Dragons Project

In collaboration with Logan Maged, we began planning for the creation of a Dungeons and Dragons tool for new players. Our project would consist of 3D models of basic classes and races from the fifth edition of Dungeons and Dragons as a way to visually allow new players to explore the character creation process in a way that makes sense to newcomers. 

Dungeons and Dragons is a hobby that both Logan and I share, and we wanted to enhance the experience for new players to the game. Originally, the project would have encompassed the entirety of the available races and classes but that project would be too big for the current budget of the grant so there were major changes to the design and aim of the grant.

Our new idea for the project is to have people take a quiz/questionnaire to determine their D&D characters with a 3D model, representing the main features of the race and classes of the participant’s results.

Roll 20 is a Digital Humanities project that has a 2D representation of characters, enemies, and battle maps to be used for D&D campaigns. This was an inspiration for what we wanted for our project. We wanted to convert the 2D animations into a 3D format that makes it easier for the newer players.


# Class Reflection

At the beginning of the course, Digital Humanities was a foreign concept to me. By the end of the course, I believe I have acquired some understanding of what Digital Humanities is comprised of. To me, Digital Humanities can best be defined as a way of connected to the humanities field of study through a digital medium, such as a website that contains an interactive map enhances the viewer’s experience. Ever since I first learned that definition of Digital Humanities, I can confidently say that my perspective on it has not changed. 

Overall, I found the readings to be less impactful than I thought they would be. The Yellow Wallpaper was my favorite reading of all the ones that were assigned, and I believe that more readings like that would be suitable for this course as that reading was most effective in a discussion-based class. The other readings felt very self-explanatory and did not feel like they needed discussing. Translating the Yellow Wallpaper into a digital format was the best part of the course and something that I believe should be replicated in future classes. I found the discussion of a story or article to be more helpful than discussion of basic techniques as I feel that those readings are very self-explanatory.

Practical application is what I always look for when I learn something in a class and the implication of the digital coding of the Yellow Wallpaper helped to give me personal experience with the field of Digital Humanities. It was just a glimpse of what the entirety of the Digital Humanities field is comprised of, but that experience helped me to understand to application and practical uses of Digital Humanities. There is a myriad of complexities to the field of Digital Humanities and while I feel this course has gave me a proper introduction, the area is too vast to fully understand as a student. I would need to spend many years of my life through much study and practical experience. 

I am grateful for taking this course and learning everything that I have about Digital Humanities and coding. This will be a course that I will put try to rememebr and put into practice.
